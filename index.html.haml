  What is it about?

%p
  Togglz is an implementation of the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">Feature Toggles</a> pattern for Java.
  Feature Toggles are a very common agile development practices in the context of continuous deployment and delivery.
  The basic idea is to associate a toggle with each new feature you are working on. This allows you to enable or disable these
  features at application runtime, even for individual users.

%a(name="example")
%h2
  Example

%p
  Features are declared using a regular Java enum type:

%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    public enum MyFeatures implements Feature {

        @Label("First Feature")
        FEATURE_ONE,

        @Label("Second Feature")
        FEATURE_TWO;

        public boolean isActive() {
            return FeatureContext.getFeatureManager().isActive(this);
        }

    }

%p
  Checking whether a specific feature is enabled for the current user is very simple. Just call the <code>isActive()</code>
  method on the feature.

%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    public void someBusinessMethod() {

      if( MyFeatures.FEATURE_ONE.isActive() ) {
        // do new exciting stuff here
      }

      [...]

    }
